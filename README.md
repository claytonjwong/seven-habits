## Inside-Out

We must look *at* the lens through which we see the world, as well as at the world we see, and that the lens itself shapes how we interpret the world.

If we want to change a situation, we first have to change ourselves; and to change ourselves effectively, we first have to change our perceptions.

### Character Ethic

> What you are shouts so loudy in my ears I cannot hear what you say.
>
-[Ralph Waldo Emerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson)

What we *are* communicates far more eloquently than anything we *say* or *do*.

There are basic principles of effective living, and people can only experience true success and enduring hapiness as they learn and integrate these principles into their basic character.

#### Paying the Piper

If you don't pay the price day in and day out, you never achieve true mastery of the subjects you study or develop an educated mind.  The price must be paid and the process followed.  We always reap what we sow; there is no shortcut.

### The Power of a Paradigm

A paradigm is the way we "see" the world: what we perceive, understand, and interpret.

#### 2 Maps

We each have many "maps" in our minds which can be divided into 2 groups:

1. We way things *are* (or *realities*)
2. The way things *should be* (or *values*)

* We interpret everything we experience through these maps, but we seldom question their accuracy; we are usually unaware that we have them.  We *assume* that the way we see things is the way they really are or the way they should be.
* The way we see things is the source of the way we think and act

⭐️ Two people can see the same thing, disagree, and yet both be right.  It's not logical, its psychological.

* To try to change outward attitudes and behaviors does very little good in the long run if we fail to examine the basic paradigms from which those attitudes and behaviors flow.
* Each of us thinks we see things as they are, that we are *objective*.  But this is not the case.  We see the world, not as *it is*, but as *we are* (or as we are conditioned to see it).

⭐️ The more aware we are of our basic paradigms, maps, or assumptions, and the extent to which we have been influenced by our experience, the more we can take responsibility for those paradigms, examine them, test them against reality, listen to others and be open to their perceptions, thereby getting a larger picture and a far more objective view.

* Most significant breakthroughs in the field of scientific endeavors began by challenging traditional methods and ways of thinking with old paradigms.
* Our paradigms are the sources of our attitudes, behaviors, and ultimately our relationships with others.
* What we *see* is highly interrelated to what we *are*.
* Paradigms are powerful because they create the lens through which we see the world.

#### Principle Centered Paradigm

Principles are guidlines for human conduct that are proven to have enduring, permanent value.  They're fundamental and unarguably self-evident (we are innately conscious and aware they exist):

* fairness
* integrity
* honesty
* service
* excellence
* patience
* nurturance
* encouragement

#### Principles of Growth and Change

⭐️ Admission of ignorance is often the first step in our education.

In all of life, there are sequential stages of growth and development.  Each step is important and each one takes times.  No step can be skipped.  It is simply impossible to violate, ignore, or shortcut this development process.  It is contrary to nature, and attempting to seek such a shortcut only results in disappointment and frustration.

To relate effectively with others, we must learn to listen.  Listening involves patience, openness, and the desire to understand.

#### A New Level of Thinking

> The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.
>
-[Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)

**Inside-out** is a process of continual renewal based on the natural laws which govern human growth and progress.

> We must not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we began and to know the place for the first time.
>
-[T.S. Elliot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._S._Eliot)
