## Inside-Out

We must look *at* the lens through which we see the world, as well as at the world we see, and that the lens itself shapes how we interpret the world.

If we want to change a situation, we first have to change ourselves; and to change ourselves effectively, we first have to change our perceptions.

### Character Ethic

> What you are shouts so loudy in my ears I cannot hear what you say.
>
-[Ralph Waldo Emerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson)

What we *are* communicates far more eloquently than anything we *say* or *do*.

There are basic principles of effective living, and people can only experience true success and enduring hapiness as they learn and integrate these principles into their basic character.

#### Paying the Piper

If you don't pay the price day in and day out, you never achieve true mastery of the subjects you study or develop an educated mind.  The price must be paid and the process followed.  We always reap what we sow; there is no shortcut.

### The Power of a Paradigm

A paradigm is the way we "see" the world: what we perceive, understand, and interpret.

#### 2 Maps

We each have many "maps" in our minds which can be divided into 2 groups:

1. We way things *are* (or *realities*)
2. The way things *should be* (or *values*)

* We interpret everything we experience through these maps, but we seldom question their accuracy; we are usually unaware that we have them.  We *assume* that the way we see things is the way they really are or the way they should be.
* The way we see things is the source of the way we think and act

⭐️ Two people can see the same thing, disagree, and yet both be right.  It's not logical, its psychological.

* To try to change outward attitudes and behaviors does very little good in the long run if we fail to examine the basic paradigms from which those attitudes and behaviors flow.
* Each of us thinks we see things as they are, that we are *objective*.  But this is not the case.  We see the world, not as *it is*, but as *we are* (or as we are conditioned to see it).

⭐️ The more aware we are of our basic paradigms, maps, or assumptions, and the extent to which we have been influenced by our experience, the more we can take responsibility for those paradigms, examine them, test them against reality, listen to others and be open to their perceptions, thereby getting a larger picture and a far more objective view.

* Most significant breakthroughs in the field of scientific endeavors began by challenging traditional methods and ways of thinking with old paradigms.
* Our paradigms are the sources of our attitudes, behaviors, and ultimately our relationships with others.
* What we *see* is highly interrelated to what we *are*.
* Paradigms are powerful because they create the lens through which we see the world.

#### Principle Centered Paradigm

Principles are guidlines for human conduct that are proven to have enduring, permanent value.  They're fundamental and unarguably self-evident (we are innately conscious and aware they exist):

* fairness
* integrity
* honesty
* service
* excellence
* patience
* nurturance
* encouragement

#### Principles of Growth and Change

⭐️ Admission of ignorance is often the first step in our education.

In all of life, there are sequential stages of growth and development.  Each step is important and each one takes times.  No step can be skipped.  It is simply impossible to violate, ignore, or shortcut this development process.  It is contrary to nature, and attempting to seek such a shortcut only results in disappointment and frustration.

To relate effectively with others, we must learn to listen.  Listening involves patience, openness, and the desire to understand.

#### A New Level of Thinking

> The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.
>
-[Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)

**Inside-out** is a process of continual renewal based on the natural laws which govern human growth and progress.

> We must not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we began and to know the place for the first time.
>
-[T.S. Elliot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._S._Eliot)


## The 7 Habits: An Overview

> We are what we repeatedly do.  Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.
>
-[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle)

Habits are powerful factors in our lives.  Because they are consistent, often unconscious patterns, they constantly, daily, express our character and produce our effectiveness (or ineffectiveness).  Habits can be learned and unlearned; it involves a process and a tremendous commitment.  Breaking deeply embedded habitual tendencies such as procrastination, impatience, criticalness, or selfishness that violate basic principles of human effectiveness involves more than a little willpower and a few minor changes in our lives.  "Lift off" takes a tremendous effort.

### "Habits" Defined

We will define a habit as the intersection of knowledge, skill, and desire.  In order to make something a habit in our lives, we have to have all three.

* **Knowledge** is the theoretical paradigm, the *what to do* and the *why to do it*
* **Skill** is the *how to do it*
* **Desire** is the motivation, the *want to do it*

The being/seeing change is an upward process - being changing seeing, which in turn changes being, and so forth, as we move in an upward spiral of growth.  By working on knowledge, skill, and desire, we can break through to new levels of personal and interpersonal effectiveness as we break with old paradigms that may have been a source of pseudo-security for years.

* **Happiness** can be defined as the fruit of the desire and ability to sacrafice what we want *now* for what we want *eventually*, ie. we can postpone instant gratification for long-term fulfillment.

Reaching our full physical maturity does *not* necessarily assure us of simultaneous emotional or mental maturity:

* **Dependent** people need others to get what they want.
  * the paradigm of *you*:
    *  *you* take care of me,
    *  *you* come through for me
    *  *you* didn't come through for me
    *  *you* are to blame for the results
  * letting the weaknesses of others ruin our emotional lives
  * feeling victimized by others and events outside our control
* **Independent** people can get what they want through their own effort.
  * the paradigm of *I*:
    * *I* can do it
    * *I* am responsible
    * *I* am self-reliant
    * *I* can choose
  * allows us to act, rather than be acted upon
  * frees us of the dependence on others and circumstances
* **Interdependent** people combine their own efforts with the efforts of others to achieve their greatest success.
  * the paradigm of *we*:
    * *we* can do it
    * *we* can cooperate
    * *we* can combine our talents and abilities and create something greater together
  * is a choice only independent people can make
  * dependent people cannot choose to be interdependent because they don't have sufficient character to do it; they don't own enough of themselves

We cannot invert the process of personal growth from dependence to independence to interdependence anymore than we can harvest a crop before we plant it.  It is an inside-out process and no steps can be skipped.  That is why private victories precede public victories.

Continuous improvement creates an upward spiral of growth that lifts us to new levels of understanding and living each of the 7 habits as we come around to them on a progressively higher plane.

### "Effectiveness" Defined

The 7 habits are habits of *effectiveness*.  They become the basis of a person's character, creating an empowering center of correct maps from which an individual can effectively solve problems, maximize opportunities, and continually learn and integrate other principles in an upward spiral of growth.

True effectiveness is a function of two things: what is produced (the golden eggs) and the producing asset or capacity to produce (the goose).  Effectiveness lies in the P/PC balance:
* **P**roduction: the desired results (the golden eggs)
* **P**roduction **C**apability: the ability or asset (that produces the golden eggs)
  * Our most important financial asset is our own capacity to earn.  If we don't continually invest in improving our own PC, we severely limit our options.  We're locked into our present situation, running scared of our organization or our boss's opinion of us, economically dependent and defensive.
  * Always treat your employees exactly as you want them to treat your best customers.  We can buy a person's hand, but we can't buy their heart.  Their heart is where their enthusiasm and loyalty reside.  We can buy their back, but we can't buy their brain.  Their brain is their source of creativity, ingenuity, and resourcefulness.
  * PC work is treating employees as volunteers; they volunteer their best parts - their hearts and minds.

P/PC balance is the very essence of effectiveness.

### What You Can Expect

Each of us guards a "gate of change" that can only be opened from the inside.  If we decide to open our "gate of change" several positive things will happen.  Our growth will be *evolutionary*, but the net effect will be *revolutionary*.
* increased self-confidence
* know ourselves in a deeper more meaningful way
  * our nature, deepest values, unique contribution capabilities
  * as we live our values, our sense of identity, integrity, control, and inner-directedness will infuse us with both exhiliration and peace
* define ourselves from within, rather than by other's opinions or comparisons to others
  * we will find that we care less about what others think of us, and we will care more about what others think of themselves and their worlds, including their relationship with us.
  * we will find it easier and more desirable to change because our core-values are immutable
* replace old patterns of self-defeating behavior with new patterns of effectiveness, happiness, and trust-based relationships

#### Be Patient With Ourselves

Self-growth is tender; it's holy ground.  There's no greater investment.  Obviously it's *not* a quick fix.

> That which we obtain too easily, we esteem too lightly
